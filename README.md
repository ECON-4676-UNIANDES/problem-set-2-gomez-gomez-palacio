## Data
We used geographic data from the city of Evanston, a city in the Chicagoland area to graph our maps. the description of the files used is presented below (the names of the files are self-explanatory):
* **cblock.zip**: a compressed shapefile that contains 777 geometry entities corresponding to city blocks.
* **ctract.zip**: a compressed shapefile with the information of the population census divided into 18 territory divisions. Each one of that division aggregate many blocks.
* **El Lines.zip**: also known as the "The Purple Line of the Chicago". El Lines contains the geographic information of the metro line.
* **El Stations.zip**: 11 points corresponding to El's train stations
* **evanston.zip**: the geographic polygon of the city. We don't use this data. We have an ace up our sleeve. 
* **evanston_parcel_data.csv**: a CSV file that contains the information of 22.339 parcels in Evanston city. Some variables included are: Land Square Feet, Rooms, Bedrooms, Age, Total Building Square Feet, etc. 
* **Lake Michigan.zip**: geographic polygon of the Lake Michigan.
* **Major Roads.zip**: geographic lines correspondig to the principal avenues of the city. 
* **Metra Stops.zip**: Metra is the commuter rail system that serves the greater Chicago area. The Union Pacific North Line (UP-N), which connects Chicago‚Äôs northern suburbs to downtown Chicago, has stops at Main, Davis, and Central in Evanston. This compressed files contains 3 points.
* **Rail Lines.zip**: geographic lines correspondig to the rail lines. 

Also, we use external files from the [Open Data website of the Evanston city](data.cityofevanston.org) to enrich our models:
